- TODO: TEST (also check back after audit competitions (codeHawk challenge) and add any test cases that were missed!! Before/During the codehawk challenge I plan on implementing any tests I'm missing from the base repo as well tests of my own to reach over 85% coverage ON EVERYTHING)
    1. use forge coverage --report debug
